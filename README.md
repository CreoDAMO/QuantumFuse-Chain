# QuantumFuse Chain

## Overview

QuantumFuse is a next-generation blockchain platform that leverages quantum computing, advanced cryptography, and innovative consensus mechanisms to create a secure, scalable, and sustainable blockchain ecosystem.

## Key Features

- Sharded architecture for high scalability
- Post-quantum cryptography for future-proof security
- Green Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism
- Smart contracts with visual builder
- NFT marketplace with fractional ownership and cross-chain support
- Decentralized Exchange (DEX) integration
- Layer 2 scaling solutions
- AI-driven optimization for transaction routing and network efficiency
- VR/AR integration for blockchain visualization
- Fusion reactor simulation for educational purposes
- Environmental impact tracking and carbon credit system

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 14+
- GNU Make
- GNU Parallel (optional, for parallel linting)
- Blender (for 3D visualizations)

## Setup and Installation

### Backend (Python)

1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Frontend (Node.js)

1. Will be updated shortly

### GNU Parallel (Optional)

To install GNU Parallel on Ubuntu/Debian:
```
sudo apt-get install parallel
```

On macOS with Homebrew:
```
brew install parallel
```

## Running the Project

1. Start the blockchain node:
   ```
   python quantumfuse_node.py
   ```

2. Start the API server:
   ```
   python blockchain_api.py
   ```

3. Open `ui_dashboard.html` in a web browser to access the dashboard.

## Development

- Use `make lint` to run linters
- Use `make lint-parallel` to run linters in parallel (requires GNU Parallel)
- Use `make test` to run unit tests
- Use `make build` to build the project
- Use `make run` to start the blockchain node
- Use `make clean` to remove build artifacts

## Testing

We use pytest for our test suite. To run all tests:

```
make test
```

Our test suite includes:
- Unit tests for all components
- Integration tests for cross-component functionality
- Concurrency tests to ensure thread safety
- Network partition simulation tests
- Performance tests under various loads
- Fuzzing tests for unexpected inputs
- Upgrade tests for smooth system updates
- Cross-shard transaction tests
- Quantum resistance tests
- Environmental impact tracking tests
- VR/AR visualization component tests
- AI optimization tests

## CI/CD Pipeline

Our CI/CD pipeline includes:
- Automated testing on every pull request
- Automated builds and deployments to staging environments
- Performance benchmarking
- Automated security scans
- Deployment to production upon successful completion of all checks
